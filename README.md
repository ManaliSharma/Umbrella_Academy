# Social Butterfly Project:- Content Optimization and Content Creation
## Overview
Social Butterfly is a social media engagement software project which is a part of the NEU AI Skunkworks Project team. We propose to create a software that performs the task of content optimization and then publishes the same optimized content on one or more social media platform (viz. Twitter, Skunkworks, Instagram etc.). Publishing content on social media is the fastest way to reach audience so the content that should be posted and the timing at which it should be posted is of prime importance. Finding new content is incredibly hard, we are also proposing to employ machine learning methods to create new content after training the models on the given data. These are the two major tasks that we propose to tackle in our Project.
